And one of the things I wanted to address with technology. I think that we need to be looking into things that can help the community instead of helping law enforcement. One thing in technology that I was thinking about is that fact that we should be using it to upgrade public toilets. We talked about parks earlier. I was looking at a thing on YouTube. You guys can Google it and you check it out. It's self-cleaning toilets. When we can address the unhoused issue and also with some of our communities, parks and recreation centers being able to be cleaned and not vandalized, I urge you to Google and check it out because these are made of stainless steel. There's nothing that anybody really can damage in there and they'll be better at keep with the maintenance crew as far as with the city goes.
